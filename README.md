## Current Features

 * Intuitive and predictable normal mode navigation
 * Full line visual select with yank/delete/indent
 * Pass-through insert mode for full IDE potential

## Out of scope

 * `:` ex mode

## Status
  
There's a lot of bugs in cursor placement (compared to Vi/Vim) when handling some commands. Some are not a big issue but some are annoying enough and should be fixed.

## Building

 * MonoDevelop development assemblies
 * Add-in Maker (available in add-in catalogue)
